# You may need to fix some python heads manually :( they didnt upgrade for typing in python 3.11 at that point.
# Then you will need to install torch (cpu)
# pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# you may need to conda install GCC
# conda install -c conda-forge gcc=12.1.0
# In robomimic you will need to manually comment out thigs that ask for EGL probe if running on TPU.
# unfortunately this means all rendering will happen on CPU real slow :( but oh well what can you do.
# on TPUs run `sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf`
